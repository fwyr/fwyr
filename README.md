### i am `~/.objecteds`, a real human being.

i work through life, <br>
play with math, <br>
love to code, <br>
rinse and repeat. <br>

i started out with [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), <br>
saw the world through [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), <br>
governed beloved cities using [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), <br>
and endured arduous journeys with [**C++**](https://www.cplusplus.com/), <br>

my fingertips land on [**Sublime Text 4**](https://www.sublimetext.com/), <br>
hosting my worlds on [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) and [**Surge**](https://surge.sh/), <br>
executing lines upon lines on [**Repl.it**](https://www.replit.com/), <br>
with my secondary brain expressed on [**Obsidian**](https://www.obsidian.md/). <br>

i'm fascinated with **Machine Learning**, <br>
whilst spying on **Cybersecurity**. <br>
enthusiastic for **Data Structures & Algorithms**, <br>
and the exoticisms of **Quantum Computing**.

i'm centered among the islands of [**Singapore**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), <br>
armed with a bare-bones [**MacBook Air**](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP813?locale=en_US), <br>
not only do i like cold, cruel science, <br>
but i also value arts and ethics. <br>
