### i am `~/.objecteds`, a real human being.

i work through life, <br>
play with math, <br>
love to code, <br>
rinse and repeat. <br>

started out with [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), <br>
saw the world through [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) and [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), <br>
enduring arduous journeys with [**C++**](https://cplusplus.com/), <br>
learning modernity using [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org/).

fascinated with **Machine Learning**, <br>
whilst spying on **Cybersecurity**. <br>
enthusiastically studying **Data Structures & Algorithms**, <br>
and the exoticisms of **Quantum Computing**.

centered among the islands of [**Singapore**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), <br>
armed with a bare-bones [**MacBook Air**](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP813?locale=en_US), <br>
not only do i like cold, cruel science, <br>
but i also value music, literature, and privacy. <br>
